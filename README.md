# 42 Berlin Logo 3D Printing Files

This repository contains the 3D model files for the 42 Berlin Logo, designed to be printed in multiple parts with a dual-color scheme managed directly in the slicer software. The black and white models have been removed with the current commit, simplifying the printing process.

## Dimensions
The dimensions of the full model are **350 x 400 x 35 mm**. The thickness has been reduced to save filament while maintaining structural integrity.

## File Structure

### Main Files
- `42_logo_full_model_final.stl`: Complete STL of the assembled logo.
- `42_logo_full_model_final_picture.png`: Rendered image of the model.

### Individual Parts
Each part is represented by a single STL file:

1. **Top-Right Part**
   - `42_logo_1_tr_final.stl`: Complete part.

2. **Bottom-Right Part**
   - `42_logo_2_br_final.stl`: Complete part.

3. **Bottom-Left Part**
   - `42_logo_3_bl_final.stl`: Complete part.

4. **Top-Left Part**
   - `42_logo_4_tl_final.stl`: Complete part.

## Printing Instructions

### General Guidelines
1. Use the `.stl` files for slicing in your preferred 3D printing software (e.g., Cura).
2. Manage the dual-color scheme directly in the slicer software. Set up the appropriate color changes for the layers or regions as needed.

### Steps
1. **Prepare Files**: Load the corresponding `.stl` files for each part.
2. **Color Settings**: Configure the slicer for dual-color printing. 
3. **Assembly**: Once all parts are printed, assemble the sections together to form the full logo. Use the complete `.stl` files as a reference for proper alignment.

## LED Integration
- The model includes holes for LEDs, designed to match the inner diameter of a standard glass bottle.
- Adjustments may be required based on the LEDs used for the final assembly.

## Notes
- The complete model (`42_logo_full_model_final.stl`) can be used for preview purposes but is not intended for direct printing due to its complexity.
- Ensure sufficient adhesion on your print bed for optimal results.
- If any issues arise during slicing or printing, refer to the Fusion 360 file (`42_logo_full_model_final.f3z`) for further customization or adjustments.
